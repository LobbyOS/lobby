RemoteCP Versioning format
==========================
##x.y.z format

1. x is the major version number for backwards incompatible changes (e.g. removed functions)
2. y is the minor version number for backwards compatible changes (e.g. added functions)
3. z is the patch number, for bug fixes

##Comparators
Lower version: <
Higher version: >
Lower or equal version: <=
Higher or equal version: >=
x or * as a wildcard
  e.g.: 1.x.x		>= 1.0.0 < 2.0.0
        1.2.*		>= 1.2.0 < 1.3.0
A range can be expressed with -
  e.g.: 1.0.0 - 1.2.3		>=1.0.0 <1.2.3
        1.2.0 - 2.0.0		>=1.2.0 <2.0.0
A range can be expressed by omitting lower order numbers
  e.g.: 1		>=1.0.0 <2.0.0
        1.2		>=1.2.0 <1.3.0
A range can be expressed with ~
  e.g.: ~1		>=1.0.0 <2.0.0
        ~1.2	>=1.2.0 <1.3.0
        ~1.2.3	>=1.2.3 <1.3.0

##Logic
Two or more comparators in one string with only spaces between them: AND
||: OR
