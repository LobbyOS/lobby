<!--
  Hi! Thanks for considering to file a bug with Lobby. Please take the time to
  answer the basic questions. You can convert `[ ]` into `[x]` to check boxes (or submit
  and check.) If there is no need for certain fields like output and redirection, please delete
  those headers before submitting. We know not all tickets require those steps.
  Otherwise, please try to be as detailed as possible.
  
  If you are unsure this is a bug in Lobby, or this is a bug caused
  by a plugin that isn't directly related to Lobby, or if this is just
  a generic usage question, please consider asking your question at
  https://gitter.im/subins2000/lobby where non-bug questions go.
  
  Thanks!

## My Reproduction Steps
<!--
  Insert the steps you took to for this problem to exist. Such as the
  directories you created and, the full command you ran, and include any
  plugins you have installed, this is very important.
  
  If your steps are complicated, you can also submit a Github
  repository (please no zips, they will be removed and rejected by maintainers,)
  and just supply a command for us to reproduce it ourselves.
-->

## The Output I Wanted
<!-- 
  Insert the output from the command. Alter it as little as you can.
  The minimum should be personal information. Though we normally don't log
  anything like that so there should be no need to alter it.
